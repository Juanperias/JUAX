# JUAX

Juax is a processor architecture which is ultra simple, and even Juax is so simple that it only has one logic gate which is the OR.

You can run this in [tinkercard](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/dvDghaHYBDT-juax?sharecode=ARfksbzSr7kshmbhWUiPPNNvIqs6EV_QW6Wh07MxfpE)

# How does juax work?

juax has two registers a and b which are actually two NPN transistors, and it also has a logic gate which is OR which turns on an LED if one or both registers are on.

To visually represent the state of the two registers, if a register is on 1 a led is turned on, if it is on 0 the led will be off.

# Does it serve of something juax?

no, it does not serve of anything juax, but it is interesting to learn.
